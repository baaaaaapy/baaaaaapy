# Hey all ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm **bappy**. Some may know me by **arrdev**, some may know me by **baps**. Whatever you call me is up to you. I focus on **discord bots**, but I would like to try and get better at web development.
## Projects
My current project is a bot called fetch. It's not really public yet, but I will give you the link when it is.
